## Welcome to my Christmas list thingy.

So I've been asking what my Christmas list will be for this year quite a few times.
I was too lazy to text all of you individually, so I'm doing this thing. (Yes I know, this is quite the opposite of lazy).
Let's just get right into it, shall we?
##
#### 1. [PS4 Pro](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4-pro/)
The PS4 Pro is the first thing on my christmas list, as the one my Dad and I have is kind of breaking down. The PS4 Pro
has the ability to output 4k images, and with the upgrade of the HDMI port, from 1.6 to 2.0a, it can output higher framerates
as long as the game supports it. Most, if not all, future playstation games will require a "Pro Mode", allowing the PS4 Pro
to be used to it's potential. It also has another gigabyte of ram (I think), and another USB port. For games that contain a locked
framerate, the PS4 Pro produces a smoother locked framerate. In the end, the PS4 Pro is stronger and faster than the PS4.

#### 2. [Astro A50's](https://www.astrogaming.com/headsets/A50-GEN3-PS4.html#)
This is the headset that I want. It has a 15 hour wireless battery life, a base station to charge it, a built-in mixamp (To adjust the audio settings and fiddle with the stuff), and Dolby surround sound. It also has an online command center to fine-tune settings. In all, they have great sound, look cool, are **Wireless**, and have audio controls.

#### 3. [Acer Monitor](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-h6-series-23-ips-led-hd-monitor-black/4751006.p?skuId=4751006&ref=199&loc=zhehdLHc0f8&acampID=1&siteID=zhehdLHc0f8-YvSoRHULYARPTnE5qag5rg)
This is an extremely cheap 23 inch monitor with full 1080p and great color. It does have a 5ms response time, which could ptentially become and issue in extremely fast moving games and such, but would be fine for almost everything. It is only $80 as of now, as it is on sale **(MIGHT WANT TO GET IT SOON)**. All in all, cheap, large, and pretty good all around.
